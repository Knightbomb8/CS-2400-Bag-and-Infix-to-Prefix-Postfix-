What is this Project
---------------------

This project contains two key parts:

1. The first portion of this project is a bag that can hold students and their relevant information including first and last name, academic year
and student ID. This bag has been implemented in two ways: linked list and array. They both do the same thing but are just two different ways
to do the same thing. This bag is very helpful for holding large quantities of students in an organized manner.

2. The second part of this project is all about converting infix expression to postfix and prefix using stackswhich is very helpful. This portion 
is implemented in three ways: as a vector, as an array, and as a linkedlist. Computers are able to read expressions in postfix and prefix much faster
and use less space than that of their infix equivalent.


How To Run This Project
-----------------------

To run this project, simply execute either of the jar files and you will be able to create your bag or stack according to which jar file you execute.
